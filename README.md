There are two policies for solving the "Freight Allocation Problem".
1. Dynamic Programming (Backward Induction) : Simply run the code "Dynamic_Programming.py" in the "Dynamic Programming" folder, then you'll get the results.
2. Deep Q-Network : "model_env.py" is the environment of problem scenario. "RL_DQN.py" is used for training the DQN model. "Inference.py" is used to simulate the scenario and get the average result.
